gokakashi is a security platform to help ship secure software. It aims to

- Be centralized: You need one place to understand your security posture.
- Be vendor-agnostic and open(-sourced).
- Help teams adopt industry standards like [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/).
- For any team of any size.

We’re excited to share gokakashi early with the community to gather feedback and improve quickly.

Whether you're curious, have suggestions, or your team is looking for a fast and efficient way to streamline your security workflows (and get back to enjoying that extra ice cream 🍨 or your favorite anime 📺), we’d love to hear from you.
