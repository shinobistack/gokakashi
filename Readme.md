gokakashi is a security platform to help ship secure software.

## Motivation 🔥

- Be vendor-agnostic and open(-sourced).
- Centralized: You need one place to understand your security posture.
- Help teams adopt industry standards like [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/).
- Educate: Security is not an afterthought.
- Any team, any size.

## Features 🎁

This is useful for finding and remediating vulnerabilities present in your container images.

- Multiple registries support - scan images from various container image registries — all in one place!
- Vulnerability scanner of your choice.
- Custom notifications - Customize notifications to suit your needs, including where to get notified and control over priority, assignment, due dates etc.
- Scheduled and on-demand scans - Automate your scans with in-built cron jobs.
